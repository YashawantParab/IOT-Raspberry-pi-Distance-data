# IOT-Raspberry-pi-Distance-data
The sensor data is basically the distance of other objects from the object on which the sensor is 
mounted to avoid collision. The raw data is extracted from the Distance sensor module which measures 
the distance and stores it in the log file. To execute this, Raspberry pi, HC-SR04 Distance Sensor and 
some dependent tools were used.
